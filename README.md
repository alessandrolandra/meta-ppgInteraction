Adding the meta-ppgInteraction layer to your build
=================================================

First of all you need to clone this repository and copy the whole meta-ppgInteraction directory into your poky folder.
Then, after initializing your environment with
`source oe-init-build-env <your_build_path>`,
you have to add this layer to the image configuration by running
`bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-ppgInteraction/`.
(In alternative you can add a line in conf/bblayers.conf file reporting "<your_poky_folder>/meta-pphInteraction" inside the BBLAYERS string).

Finally, to add the newly create recipes to the image to be deployed you have to edit conf/local.conf file by adding the following lines: 
`IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " hearthmonitor ppgreader"`
`KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "ppgreader"`.

You can now build the new image by issuing the command: 
`bitbake core-image-minimal`.
